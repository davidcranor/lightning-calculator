NOTE: I'm really interested in making a Proper Reproduction composited from
many scans, so if you have access to an original print, PLEASE contact me!

Back in the 30s, the Amateur Radio Relay League released a series of circular
slide rules that allow for quick solving of commonly needed electrical
engineering calculations called Lightning Calculators.

Right now, I only have some partial scans of Type B - the Ohm's Law version.
It's pretty awesome - you can quickly find any two of resistance, voltage,
current, and power if the other two are known.

This is just a hacky prototype that I made to work out the fabrication process (it's not a
complete scan so no point in striving to make it perfect right now), so the
cutouts are a little sloppy and hand-traced.  Some of the power and microvolts
scales are not reproduced in the original scan, and there is an image of the
original wiper in the background as well.   I literally just downloaded the
images from Theodore Monk's blog and cut them apart in Photoshop.  But it works!

This project includes the master Photoshop file as well as .pdf files and
Silhouette Studio project files suitable for cutting on a Silhouette Cameo
machine.

In addition to the cardstock for the graphical bits, you'll also need some thin
transparent PETG to make the pointer and 0.25" rivets for the center bearing.

Again, I'd really like to make a real reproduction of this, so if you have one
let me know!
