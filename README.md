### **NOTE: I'm really interested in making a Proper Reproduction composited from many scans, so if you have access to an original print, PLEASE [contact me!](mailto:hello@davidcranor.com)**

Back in the 30s, the Amateur Radio Relay League released a series of circular slide rules that allow for quick solving of commonly needed electrical engineering calculations called Lightning Calculators.

Right now, I only have some partial scans of Type B - the Ohm's Law version. It's pretty awesome - you can quickly find any two of resistance, voltage, current, and power if the other two are known.

This is just a hacky prototype that I made to work out the fabrication process (it's not a complete scan so no point in striving to make it perfect right now), so the cutouts are a little sloppy and hand-traced.  Some of the power and microvolts scales are not reproduced in the original scan, and there is an image of the original wiper in the background as well.   I literally just downloaded the images from [Theodore Munk's blog](http://munk.org/typecast/2014/05/02/paper-calculators-the-lightning-calculator-1932-and-the-color-helm-1940/) and cut them apart in Photoshop.  But it works!

This project includes the master Photoshop file as well as .pdf files and Silhouette Studio project files suitable for cutting on a Silhouette Cameo machine.

In addition to the cardstock for the graphical bits, you'll also need some thin transparent PETG to make the pointer and a 0.25" rivet for the center bearing.

Again, I'd really like to make a real reproduction of this, so if you have one let me know!

### Known Issues
* Some slight distortion on selector wheel.  Values are still pretty close though.
* Full size base might have something wrong with alignment marks - I have a hard time getting my Cameo to recognize it.  Scissors work too :p
